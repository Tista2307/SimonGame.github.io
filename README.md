# SimonGame.github.io
In this project, a simple version of the Simon game has been implemented using DOM manipulation JQuery. 
The player will be provided with an audio(particular sound)-visual(scaling) prompt for a certain colour, at every level. 
The user needs to remember the enter sequence correctly and regenerate it by pressing the colour in correct order again.
